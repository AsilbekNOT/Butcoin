          With the development of electronic systems, ideas have repeatedly
          arisen to create an electronic analogue of cash for remote payment.
          But the stumbling block was the potential for double spending.the same
          funds. When paying in cash, double spending never occurs due to the
          fact that payment is accompanied by a transfer of money and the buyer
          cannot pay it again to another seller - because he no longer has this
          money. But electronic systems are inherent in the ability to copy the
          state, which allows you to make complete copies of the system and then
          make several payments from the same starting state, that is, spend the
          same funds in different directions. The problem was solved only with
          the help of trusted intermediaries who keep records of payments and
          guarantee payments only within the framework of the availability of
          funds. This is how all non-cash payment systems work - traditionally
          banks or other payment system operators act as intermediaries [12] .
